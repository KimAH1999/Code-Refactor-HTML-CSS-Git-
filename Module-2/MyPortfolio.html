            <li>Hello! My name is Kimberly Aguilar (She/her) and many people like to call me Kim. I am hoping to finish my General Education this year(2022) and complete a fast program with UCSD Extention to become a computer analysis. I enjoy math and also had previous experience in high school in the Robotics club for three years and that has brought me to want to gain more skills to be able to grow my knowledge and capabilities. For fun, I would relax with my boyfriend and watch Netflix or play video games after work. We would also walk our dogs around balboa and get fresh air to help blow off steam in us and our doggies. I am more into everything except county because it doesn’t get my attention compared to all others songs around the world. The most inconvenient superpower would be to rewind time. I like to push over the obstacles in life, and I wouldn’t want to relive some of them, but I would never use the power because I like making plans and having others remember what happened. I am a huge Marvel and horror fangirl. I enjoy inspiring and scary movies because they bring my attention more than others.
            </li>
        
            <li> As a student, I enjoy searching up any questions I have on google when I need help. One main website that has been very benificial these first weeks of bootcamp was  <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">Web technology references</a>, it has proven to be helpful and very knowledgable to help me grow. 
            </li>

            <li>If not MDN , Github, Gitlab, Google, and my classmates have been very supportive and always there when I need the support.
            </li>
