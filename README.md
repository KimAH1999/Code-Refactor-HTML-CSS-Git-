As one of many that just want to grow and learn new skills. I decided to take my first step and decided to gain as much as information as I can from this bootcamp program with UCSD Extention. As of Septempber 2021, I Kimberly Aguilar Hermoso, decided to put my full effort to embedding all the information for the greater good in our future.

Having been in college since 2017 has helped open my mind and grow my brain to other aspects of knowledge in the world. Now completeling my General Education soon this year has helped me know what to spread to the world and how to connect to them.
